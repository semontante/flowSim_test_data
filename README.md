# flowSim_test_data

Each folder contains data related to a different test for the evaluation of the flowSim performance. The datasets with manual references (Dataset_1-10) were used to test the identification of homogeneous patterns. The small co-mixed data with gradual mixing was used to test the identification of subtle homogeneous patterns. The large co-mixed datasets with 13, 31 and 61 bins (respectively 25%,10% an 5% mixing) were used to test the efficiency of filtering as the density patterns become more similar (i.e., the level of mixing decreases).
